# CV Application

## Introduction

This is my first React project, which is a small CV application. This application takes a set of user information and uses it to create a simple CV. It uses both functional (main branch) and class (class branch) components to write the app.

## Goals and Objectives

- Use class components when working on this project for the first, then translate into functional components
- Application should include a section to add general information, educational experience, and practical experience
- Submitted information can be edited again

## Skills Emphasized in this Project

- JSX Coding
- Becoming familiar with props and state in both class and functional components
- Lifecycle methods & Hooks
- Changing states without mutating current values
- Putting event handlers in React
- Responsive styling

## Thoughts After Completion

I've learned many things about states during this project, on how to change them better using methods that doesn't directly mutate them. Though I can say I'm still not satisfied on where I placed my props and states, and how I handled them. I think I can do better on the next project.
